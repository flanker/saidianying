# Sai Dian Ying 晒电影

A pet project for new movies' trailers and posters.

## Tech

Current project is totally a static website generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for development/build and [Aliyun](http://www.aliyun.com/) for production infrastructure. 

## Scenario

Please not these web pages are not designed for desktop browsers. Instead, they are supposed to be shared via [WeChat](http://www.wechat.com/) mobile app. Share the movie page url to your WeChat friends or in your WeChat Moments(朋友圈).

## Movies

* [Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation](saidianying.zhendewudi.com/movies/mission-impossible-rogue-nation.html)
* [007: Spectre](http://saidianying.zhendewudi.com/movies/007-spectre.html)
* [Captain America: Civil War](http://saidianying.zhendewudi.com/movies/captain-america-civil-war.html)

## Movies to be added

* Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice
* Star Wars: the Force Awakens

## TODO list

* [ ] Automate the trailer video downloading (from YouTube) and uploading (to Aliyun)
* [ ] Automate the posters image processing (resize, collcate, optimize)
* [ ] Eliminate the current duplication between each pages
